Welcome to the *OmniLayer* Github blog. We already have a http://blog.omni.foundation[Blog] elsewhere, so it's not sure how much we'll use the blogging feature of this site.

Since this blog can be authored in the http://asciidoctor.org[AsciiDoctor] format, it is well-suited for technical writing, so we may use it for some more technical communications.

This will be presented to the team on August 4, 2015.
