In the beginning (before the Exodus Block) there was the https://sites.google.com/site/2ndbtcwpaper/2ndBitcoinWhitepaper.pdf[Second Bitcoin Whitepaper], which evolved into the *Mastercoin Specification* and then the link:omni-protocol-specification.html[Omni Protocol Specification].

Perhaps we should create a new Omni Layer Whitepaper without the details of the specification and place it here.
